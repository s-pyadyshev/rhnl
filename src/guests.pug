          h1 Welcome to the Netherlands!
          p When you first arrive in the Netherlands and you can’t stay with family or friends, a lot is uncertain. The Dutch Government offers shelter, but maybe you prefer to stay with private individuals, such as families who want to welcome you in the Netherlands by offering a private space within their home. Through RefugeeHomeNL you and your family can stay with a Dutch host for a predetermined period of time. During this period you will live in a safe and homely environment in a private individual’s home.
